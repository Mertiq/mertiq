Hi 👋 My name is Mert İshak Kılıç
=================================

Jr. Game Developer
------------------

I am in the last year of my Computer Engineering education. I have been learning coding for 5 years. In this journey that I started with Java, I also made small projects using Python, Javascript and C languages. Eventually, I realized that my real passion is game development, and I learned Unity and C# on that. I am currently working as Jr Game Developer at Yin Yang Games company, Reincarnation project.
